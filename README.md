# Exoplanet Project Proposal
This is the proposal of my datavisualization project. My goal with this project is to give a structured and easy to use interactive overview of all known exoplanets.

## Features
The user will be able to choose to display all known exoplanets in the sky or in a scatterplot with different possible axes. This enables the user to explore the collection of all discovered exoplanets and look for correlations between different values like planetary mass and time of discovery.
In the sky coordinate system or scatterplot, exoplanets can be selected to give the user detailed information about its values. A model of the planetary system will be displayed and perhaps the original data of discovery or additional measurements.
